Reviewing a paper is a huge responsibility, to the authors and to the readers.
I try my best to give an honest, useful, and well grounded feedback.

This is one of my favorite pieces of advice about the reviewing process. A good
summary sets the ground for a profitable "dialogue" between the reviewer and the
authors.

Repetability, Replicability, and Reproducibility are very important in our field,
especially when papers present novel tools or conduct many experiments.
I was happy to be part of the [ACM WiSec 2019 Replicability Committee][3].
