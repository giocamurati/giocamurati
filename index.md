<!--### About me-->

I am Giovanni Camurati, a postdoc in the [System Security Group][eth-syssec] at
[ETH Zurich][ethz], under the supervision of Pr. [Srdjan Capkun][srdjan].

Before, I was a Ph.D. student in the [System and Software Security
Group][s3] at [EURECOM][eurecom], under the
supervision of Pr. [Aurélien Francillon][aurel] (co-advised
by Pr. [Ludovic Apvrille][ludovic]). During my Ph.D.,
I had the chance to work with Pr. [François-Xavier Standaert][fx]
and visit [UCL Crypto Group][ucl-crypto] at [UCLouvain][ucl].

### Research

I love studying the interplay of hardware, software, and radios in embedded
systems, to improve their security. My research focuses on novel side channel
attacks on wireless devices ([Screaming Channels][screaming]),
but I have also worked on the dynamic analysis
of embedded software ([Inception][inception]),
and I am interested by System-on-Chip security
([first academic place][hack-dac-19-win]
at [Hack@DAC19][hack-dac-19] with the team NOPS). 
I also worked on a research project funded by a [Google Faculty
Research Award][google-faculty-award]
granted to my Ph.D. supervisor [Aurélien Francillon][aurel].

### Teaching

At EURECOM I helped with the [Wireless Security course][eurecom-wisec].
I also gave an online guest lecture on this topic at VU Amsterdam.

### Education

I hold a Ph.D. from [Sorbonne Université][sorbonne], and a MS in Electronic Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino][polito]
(cum laude) and from [Télécom-ParisTech][tpt]
([Diplôme d'ingénieur][diplome]). I did a 6-month internship at [Arm][arm],
in the CPU design center of Sophia-Antipolis, where many Arm processors were born
(e.g., [Cortex-A75][cortex-a75]).

### Personal

Skiing, sailing, hiking, traveling, learning languages, and
designing/building radio controlled model planes ([old video][discus])
are some of my interests outside work. Recently I have been fascinated with
[rubber-powered gyrocopters][gyro].
