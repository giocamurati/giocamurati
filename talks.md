During these years I had the chance to present my work at several conferences
and events.
I discovered that I really enjoy the entire process around a presentation:
deciding what message to convey for a given audience, preparing the slides,
practicing with colleagues to get their feedback, practicing alone to be fluent,
presenting it to the audience and answering their questions, and, last but not
least, further discussing about it in small groups after the talk.

The main reason why I like this process is that I constantly learn from others.
Every single time I received at least one challenging question or comment that
made me think about my work from new perspectives, and gave me new ideas. I was
surprized to see that this happens even when I present the same work several
times.

The most challenging and rewarding experiences were:
+ **Screaming Channels at Black Hat USA 2018** (With Marius Muench): first talk about Screaming Channels,
   and in front of a large audience (about 400 people).<br/>
   [Video][1] [Slides][2]
+ **Screaming Channels at ACM CCS 2018**: first presentation of a paper
   at an academic conference, alone.<br/>
   [Video][3] [Slides][4] [Paper][11] [Code&Data][12] [Details][13]
+ **Screaming Channels at RESSI 2019 (Invited Talk)**: first public talk in French
   (my second foreign language).<br/>
   [Slides][5] (in English)
