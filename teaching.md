As a Ph.D. student, I am involved in some of the teaching activities at [EURECOM][1].

### Helping with the Wireless Security Course

During the last two years (2020-2019/2019-2018) my supervisor [Aur√©lien Francillon][0] gave me the
opportunity to help with the preparation of his new [Wireless Security Course][2]. I am very
happy to learn from him. My main contributions are:

1. **Labs**<br/>
   I am responsible for preparing and supervising the two lab sessions, as well
   as helping the students that need extra advice between the sessions.

2. **Projects**<br/>
   We follow around 20 student groups working on 20 different projects. I am
   very involved in this, from proposing project ideas to helping the students
   and managing hardware and instruments. Keeping track of 20 different subjects
   and groups and dozens of devices is a bit challenging and time consuming, but
   very rewarding.

3. **Demos**<br/>
   During each class I present some demos about the topics discussed in the
   course. Over the last two year I have built a small collection,
   and started to automate some of them.

4. **Other**<br/>
   In general, I help with the preparation of the course, the exam, the
   communication with the students, etc.

### Proposing and supervising semester projects

Every semester, together with my supervisor and my colleagues, we propose
several subjects that the students can choose as semester projects. When a
project is selected, we supervise it along the semester, at the end of which the
students have to write a report and make a presentation.

During my Ph.D. I helped proposing and supervising several projects on various
topics. Often, students need to borrow some hardware or learn to use some
laboratory equipment (e.g. spectrum analyzer). I usually help with this for all
projects.

### Exam supervision

Every semester we are asked to help with the supervision of exams. We have to
insure that exams start and end on time, and that students behave correctly.
