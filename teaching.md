### VU Amsterdam

#### Guest lecture on Wireless Security (2020/11/25, online)

In 2020 I was invited by Marius Muench to give a guest lecture on the topic of Wireless Security
at VU Amsterdam. This was my first time designing and teaching a full lecture on
my own, and it was an enriching experience. I enjoyed preparing it and
interacting with the students. After a short background on radio
communications, the lecture covered the main challenges
in Wireless Security, followed by some examples of tools and attacks. I have
also introduced Emission Security and Screaming Channels. 
I received good feedback and I look forward to future opportunities like this
one.

### EURECOM

As a Ph.D. student, I am involved in some of the teaching activities at [EURECOM][1].

#### Helping with the Wireless Security Course

During the last three years (2020-2018) my supervisor [Aur√©lien Francillon][0] gave me the
opportunity to help with the preparation of his new [Wireless Security Course][2]. I am very
happy to learn from him. My main contributions are:

1. **Labs**<br/>
   I am responsible for preparing and supervising the two lab sessions, as well
   as helping the students that need extra advice between the sessions.

2. **Projects**<br/>
   We follow around 20 student groups working on 20 different projects. I am
   very involved in this, from proposing project ideas to helping the students
   and managing hardware and instruments. Keeping track of 20 different subjects
   and groups and dozens of devices is a bit challenging and time consuming, but
   very rewarding. I have also supervised a 5-day student project.

3. **Demos**<br/>
   During each class I present some demos about the topics discussed in the
   course. Over the last two years I have built a small collection,
   and started to automate some of them.

4. **Other**<br/>
   In general, I help with the preparation of the course, the exam, the
   communication with the students, etc.

#### Proposing and supervising semester projects

Every semester, together with my supervisor and my colleagues, we propose
several subjects that the students can choose as semester projects. When a
project is selected, we supervise it along the semester, at the end of which the
students have to write a report and make a presentation.

During my Ph.D. I helped proposing and supervising several projects on various
topics. Often, students need to borrow some hardware or learn to use some
laboratory equipment (e.g. spectrum analyzer). I usually help with this for all
projects.

#### Exam supervision

Every semester we are asked to help with the supervision of exams. We have to
ensure that exams start and end on time, and that students behave correctly.
